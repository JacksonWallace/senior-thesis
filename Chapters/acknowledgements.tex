\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank Professor Indara Suarez and Doctor Daniel Spitzbart for their invaluable help in the research for and writing of this thesis. Without their direction and input, I would not have been able to complete the analysis that forms the backbone of this thesis. I would additionally like to thank the CMS Collaboration. Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family for their support and for helping to keep me sane during my research and studies.
